## Homework 1

### Problem 1

This problem focuses on variable types and coercion.

The chunk(s) below creates a data frame comprised of: \* A random sample
of size 10 from a uniform\[0, 5\] distribution \* A logical vector
indicating whether elements of the sample are greater than 2 \* A
(length-10) character vector \* A (length-10) factor vector

``` r
variable_df = tibble(
  vec_random = runif(10 , min = 0, max = 5),
## `runif` generates random uniformly distributed numbers, n is the number of observations. Min, Max are the lower and upper limits of the distribution.
  vec_logical = vec_random > 2,
  vec_char = c("A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F", "G", "H", "I", "J"),
  vec_factor = factor(c("h", "e", "l", "l", "o", "w", "o", "r", "l", "d"))
)
variable_df
```

    ## # A tibble: 10 x 4
    ##    vec_random vec_logical vec_char vec_factor
    ##         <dbl> <lgl>       <chr>    <fct>     
    ##  1      3.08  TRUE        A        h         
    ##  2      3.34  TRUE        B        e         
    ##  3      0.568 FALSE       C        l         
    ##  4      0.232 FALSE       D        l         
    ##  5      3.82  TRUE        E        o         
    ##  6      1.49  FALSE       F        w         
    ##  7      4.97  TRUE        G        o         
    ##  8      1.51  FALSE       H        r         
    ##  9      4.64  TRUE        I        l         
    ## 10      4.91  TRUE        J        d

``` r
## Taking the means of each variable in dataframe
mean(variable_df$vec_random)
```

    ## [1] 2.855483

``` r
mean(variable_df$vec_logical)
```

    ## [1] 0.6

``` r
mean(variable_df$vec_char)
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(variable_df$vec_char): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(variable_df$vec_factor)
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(variable_df$vec_factor): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

The variable `vec_random` has class numeric and the variable
`vec_logical` has classlogical. `mean` works on numeric and logical
vectors since there are quantities to use for the mean.

The variable `vec_char` has class character and the variable
`vec_factor` has class factor. `mean` does not work on character or
factor vectors there are no numerical values to serve as input.

``` r

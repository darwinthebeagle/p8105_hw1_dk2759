## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Homework 1

### Problem 1

This problem focuses on variable types and coercion.

The chunk(s) below creates a data frame comprised of:
* A random sample of size 10 from a uniform[0, 5] distribution
* A logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater than 2
* A (length-10) character vector
* A (length-10) factor vector

```{r Setup, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


```{r problem_1}
variable_df = tibble(
  vec_random = runif(10 , min = 0, max = 5),
  vec_logical = vec_random > 2,
  vec_char = c("helloworld"),
  vec_factor = factor(c("1","2","3","4","5","6","7", "8","9", "10"))
)
variable_df
```
The code above contains `runif(n, min = 0, max = 1)`. `runif` generates random uniformly distributed numbers, n is the number of observations. Min, Max are the lower and upper limits of the distribution. 
The variable `vec_random` has class `r class(variable_df$vec_random)`, and the variable `vec_factor` has class `r class(variable_df$vec_factor)`.
